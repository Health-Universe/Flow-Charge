# Flow Charge

The Fold Change Calculator for Flow Cytometry is an interactive web application that allows researchers and scientists to calculate the Fold Change in protein expression levels based on flow cytometry data. Fold Change is a widely used measure in flow cytometry and biological research to represent the relative change in protein expression between experimental and control samples.

The application provides a user-friendly interface that prompts users to input the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values for both the experimental and control groups. These values correspond to the average fluorescence intensity of a specific protein marker measured through flow cytometry experiments. Upon entering the values and clicking the "Calculate Fold Change" button, the application computes the Fold Change using the formula:

Fold Change
=
Experimental Value (MFI)
Control Value (MFI)
Fold Change= 
Control Value (MFI)
Experimental Value (MFI)
â€‹
 

The result is displayed on the screen, providing users with an immediate understanding of how much the protein expression level has changed from the control to the experimental condition.

This application is a valuable tool for researchers conducting flow cytometry experiments, enabling them to quickly and accurately calculate Fold Change values and analyze protein expression patterns. The application is designed to be intuitive, ensuring ease of use for both novice and experienced flow cytometry researchers.

Whether you are conducting a study to assess the effects of a drug or treatment on protein expression, investigating the activation state of immune cells, or analyzing the impact of genetic modifications on cellular markers, the Fold Change Calculator for Flow Cytometry can provide you with important insights into your data.
